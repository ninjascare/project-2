# Overview:

For Project 2, I created an app where individual families can go and try to make themsleves better people as a unit. This app will allow them to add any good deeds they've done or even any bad deeds. This app is to help families self reflect what they look like as a team and people.

## Future Development:

1. Be able to add points: 10 points for good deeds but remove 100 points for bad deeds

2. Whenever you enter a bad deed a dare should be accompanied it, and if they dont do the dare with prove then they lose double the points
